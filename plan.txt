# Create a class Equation :
   Members :
     Two points
     Direction (upwards or downwards)
   Methods :
     slope() #to return slope
     stringEq() #return full equation in the form "y = mx + c"

     NOTE:when calculating m store in the form of fraction so as to avoid
          rounding error as rounding off may lead to redundant slopes
          e.g.
           y = 3/7x+4



# Use dictionary to store equations already traced.


# Create a single function start the program with the following parameters:

   #code starts here
   def  start(xstart coordinate,
              ystart coordinate,
              next x point for direction,
              next y point for direction):

        move(xstart,ystart,x',y')   #x' and y' are after division by their GCD
    #code ends here


# Program must terminate when path is already traced i.e. equation present in
  dictionary and all 1s along current path
